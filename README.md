# Resume Generator

A lightweight tool to generate polished resumes from templates using Pandoc. Can export to PDF, HTML, and DOCX.

## Prerequisites
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html)

## How to run

### From root directory

By default there is a resume in the root directory, which can be used as a generic template for future applications. To generate different file types for this resume run:

```shell
make all
```

Single specific file conversions can be generated by specifying the file type as an argument to the `make` command. For example, to generate a PDF file:

```shell
make pdf
```

PDF, HTML and DOCX are supported.

#### Per application resumes

The `/applications` directory is for creating resumes for particular jobs. Each subdirectory corresponds to a specific job application. Add a `resume.md` file for that job inside its folder. This is also a good place for cover letters as a .txt file.


- Use the RESUME_DIR variable to select which application to build.

`make all RESUME_DIR=applications/<job-folder>`

- Example:
  - Build a resume for a Software Engineer role:
    - `make all RESUME_DIR=applications/software-engineer-2025`
